# Rocket-Path-RK4

## 📖 Project Overview
Code of the path of a rocket modelized by a system of ODE's.
Features:
- Modified RK4 numerical method for solving certain types of systems of ODE's.
- Numerical solution of the trajectory of a rocket given some initial variables.
- User can change initial values such as gravity, air density or mass of the fuel and see how it changes on the trayectory of the rocket.
- Graph of the evolution of the speed of the rocket along the time.
- Graph of the evolution of the mass of the fuel of the rocket along the time.
- Graph of the height and scope of the rocket.
- Comparison of the trajectories of some rockets modifying air density and initial angle.
