# Rocket-Path-RK4

## 📖 Project Overview
Code of the path of a rocket modelized by a system of ODE's.
Features:
- Modified RK4 numerical method for solving certain types of systems of ODE's.
- Numerical solution of the trajectory of a rocket given some initial variables.
- User can change initial values such as gravity, air density or mass of the fuel and see how it changes on the trayectory of the rocket.
- Graph of the evolution of the speed of the rocket along the time.
- Graph of the evolution of the mass of the fuel of the rocket along the time.
- Graph of the height and scope of the rocket.
- Comparison of the trajectories of some rockets modifying air density and initial angle.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python (3.8)

 ## 💼 Usage
 Use an open-source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python language such as Spyder.
 Copy and paste the code. Run the code and visualize the data.
 Change initial values and see how the solution changes.
